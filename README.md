This is just a heuristic, to help you quickly test your feelings about a comment. Maybe you don't want to have to educate someone, then don't engage. Perhaps you feel like feeding the trolls.. Engage away :D

# Ignore

* [ ] **Gaslight**. Attempts to paint you as crazy, dumb, less-than-worthy
* [ ] **Gatekeep**. Identifies with subject so strongly they don't want your participation to dilute their sense of ownership.
* [ ] **Ad Hominem**. Attacks you because they can't argue the actual point.
* [ ] **Thinly Veiled Bias**. Argues Subjective experiences by swooping in with cherry picked data or citations that feel deliberately designed to invalidate the subjective experience, rather than further understanding.
* [ ] **Non-Acknowledgement**. Like the overton window, never cedes anything, not even understanding your differing view.
 
# Don't tolerate for long

* [ ] **Shifts the goalpost**. Also **Strawmen** - trying not to engage in the original argument. Sometimes they change because a feeling emerges around a related argument, that's not so bad but it can be derailing and confusing.
* [ ] **with Questions**. A tendency to avoid acknowledging your arguments or questions by adding more questions.
* [ ] **yes, but**. I understand you see it that way, but... It's defintely true, but... Somtimes they're poorly presenting mitigations or complexities, othertimes, this is just a **Non-Achnowledgement**
* [ ] **Misunderstanding**. Constantly reading your words in their 'voice' - Everyone does this, applies their own perception on what they're hearing, but a good listener will try to clarify: "I think I hear you saying... ".
* 
# Engage

* [ ] **Earnest**. Does not feel made up. Person is following their truth
* [ ] **Willingness**. Seem ready to engage in conversation. You feel like they're understanding you.
